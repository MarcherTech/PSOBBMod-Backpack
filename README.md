# PSOBBMod-Backpack<br>
#### Requires the LATEST version of https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons - it was literally updated with utility functions for this mod!!<br>
Enables viewing all character's inventories and banks, as well as total wealth, from any character.<br>
# Caveats<br>
Given that there is no real way to tell if the shared bank is active or not, to enable proper handling of the shared bank, store 1 million meseta in your shared bank and keep it there.<br>
The shared bank must be accessed to update the files storing the totals and the shared bank contents.<br>
Only characters that have been logged into(have 'burst' into a lobby) will have data stored. Note the above caveat still applies.
