# PSOBBMod-Backpack<br>
# Requires the LATEST version of https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons - it was literally updated with some utility functions for this mod!!<br>
Enables viewing all character's inventories and banks, as well as total wealth, from any character.<br>
# Caveats<br>
Given that there is no real way to tell if the shared bank is active or not, to enable proper handling of the shared bank, store 1 million meseta in your shared bank and keep it there.<br>
The shared bank must be accessed to update the files storing the totals and the shared bank contents.<br>
The files storing this information are updated in real time, however the files are then cached by LUA. Use the 'Reload' button on the addons main menu to update the display.<br>
Only characters that have been logged into(have 'burst' into a lobby) will show.
