# PSOBBMod-Backpack<br>
#### Requires the LATEST version of https://github.com/Solybum/PSOBBMod-Addons - it was literally updated with utility functions for this mod!!<br>
Enables viewing all character's inventories and banks, as well as total wealth, from any character.<br>
# Caveats<br>
Until the bank is accessed after using the /bank command, the banks and totals will show incorrect data.<br>
Only characters that have been logged into(have 'burst' into a lobby) will have data stored.
